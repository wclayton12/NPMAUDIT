- Hint 1:

You can find more about npm-audit and how to use it to scan npm artifacts in the [official documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-audit).

- Hint 2:

npm audit is a command that will run a security audit on the package dependencies of the current project. It will also generate a report of security vulnerabilities.

- Hint 3:

Please make sure to use the correct version of npm to scan. We suggest using the npm-audit 8.5.5 and node v16.14.2

We have backward and forward compatibility for the npm version, but we suggest using the version 8.5.5 for this challenge to complete it successfully.

- Hint 4:
One of the CI references for the npm-audit is [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/npm-audit-action)
